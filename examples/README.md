# Examples for the Node Allocation Tool

This directory contains examples for using the **Node Allocation Tool**. These examples serve as practical guides for different stakeholders in the ecosystem.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Node Providers — Evaluating Contribution
If you are a **node provider**, you can simulate how your nodes would fit into the network.  
- Run the tool with your node data and the current topology.  
- Check whether your nodes bring value (e.g., increase decentralization, fill resource gaps, or strengthen under-provisioned subnets).

### 2. Proposal Verifiers — Ensuring Authenticity
If you are a **proposal verifier**, you can use these examples to validate that a given proposal was actually generated by the **target topology tool**.  
- Compare the proposed swaps against the tool’s optimized output.  
- Verify that the proposal follows the same constraints and fairness principles.

### 3. Network Healers — Submitting Proposals
If you want to **submit proposals to heal the network**, these examples illustrate:  
- How to detect imbalances in subnet composition.  
- How the tool generates swap sequences that move the network closer to the desired target topology.  
- How to package and submit those proposals for consideration.

### 4. De-clustering the Network
If you want to **de-cluster node providers**, the examples demonstrate:  
- How the optimizer redistributes nodes to prevent concentration by a single provider.  
- How to enforce fairness constraints to improve decentralization.
