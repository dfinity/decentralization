# Important Note Regarding Swiss Subnet in Pipeline File

The pipeline file currently includes entries for several synthetic Swiss nodes intended for the Swiss subnet. These nodes are not yet in existence and are planned for future acquisition and onboarding. They should only be acquired and onboarded once the implementation plan for the Swiss Subnet is fully confirmed.
